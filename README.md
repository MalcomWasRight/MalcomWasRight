- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Cushion
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in movie score music, creating music, and lots of random things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code, and have no idea what I'm doing yet
- âš¡ Fun fact: Jurassic Park is my favorite book/movie. I want to paint my car to look like a park explorer from the original movie
